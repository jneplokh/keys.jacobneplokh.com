[I love](https://jacobneplokh.com/sign-with-signify) both [Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) and [Signify](https://man.openbsd.org/signify) (though prefer the former). 

**Note:** Signify can verify signatures made by Minisign, but [not the other way](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign/issues/59#issuecomment-654809237). I use **Minisign** to sign *and* verify.

Here is my public key in plain text:

```
untrusted comment: minisign public key D3C1973108994552
RWRSRZkIMZfB0xnM46YX9cnlf+USFIJRKtX4Ff8rGdPLbEXy6LxxF0zQ
```

You can also [download the key](/keys/minisign-jneplokh.pub)

Part of the greatness is the short public key, so I have posted it both to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JacobNeplokh/status/1281816863392006144) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@JacobNeplokh/104493393446556167). Go verify against those sources :)
