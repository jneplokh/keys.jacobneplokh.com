While they are not keys, my identities still fit in with this website as I use my keys to prove them. My identities can be verified through PGP *and* Minisign/Signify. You're choice on how to verify.

## PGP

To verify my identities through my [PGP key](/pgp), use my [Keyoxide Page](https://keyoxide.org/me@jacobneplokh.com)

Again, my PGP fingerprint is:

`2A74DD1553821C37819CAA77E4050DE078D551BA`

## Minisign/Signify

I also sign my identities with my [Minisign key](/minisign).

Should you want to verify this way, [you can download the identities.txt file here](/keys/identities.txt) and [the signature file here](/keys/identities.txt.sig).
